# AptUni
AptUni is a platform developed over 2 weeks (15-Oct-2022 until 29-Oct-2022) that offers psychometric testing to matric learners and prospective university students
in an effort to assist them in choosing the most suitable undergraduate institution and programme. The platform 
offers 4 categories of aptitude tests (diagramatic, numerical, situational and verbal reasoning) the user can choose from. 
Based upon the APS (Admission Point Score) calculated from the user's matric results and the test scores from the aforementioned
categories of tests, the algorithm generates the most likely higher education institution, undergraduate programme and
most likely career choice (with links) based upon these scores.
Monetization for the plaform can be achieved through ads from the various higher education institutions who wish to promote their institutions and programmes.
